Hey modders!

Detection Equipment is a semi-realistic detection and EWAR mod for Space Engineers.

This is a client mod, and must reference the original framework to function. [Check out the wiki](https://github.com/ari-steas/Detection-Equipment/wiki) for more information and guides, and feel free to message @aristeas. on Discord if you have any questions or comments.
